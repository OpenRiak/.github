# The OpenRiak Project

Promoting an open, modern Riak

## Work in Progress

"Unforking" work is ongoing, as described in [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/OpenRiak/discussions/18)

As repos are detached, some things to be aware of:
* The forked version of each affected repo is renamed to `<repo-name>-forked` and made **read-only**.
* All extant branches and tags are carried over to the detached repo.
* Issues and discussions are transferreed from the forked repo to the detached one, but their numbers may have changed. They are still numbered chronologically and retain their original comments and timestamps.
* PRs cannot be transferred, though where they're referenced from issues or discussions attempts are made to fixup the references to point into the forked archive.
* If you have an outstanding PR in a forked archive (that you care about) you'll need to recreate it in the detached repo.

### This page will be updated when the work is completed.
